](https://ionicframework.com)

## Running the app

## Our Goal

Our goal is to make a free all-in-one app for Muslims
starting with providing prayer times. This will be
followed by Quran reading and recitation, athkar,
and more. The app will respect the user's right to
privacy, and will only collect data deemed
necessary for a good user experience.
